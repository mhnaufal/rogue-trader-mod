The nature of what is collected depends on the tithe grade; it can be manufactured goods, food, or even people. Each planet will have its own requirements and system for collection.\r\n\nThe Black Ships come for their toll independently and both tithes must be paid to avoid incurring the wrath of higher authorities.\r\n",
