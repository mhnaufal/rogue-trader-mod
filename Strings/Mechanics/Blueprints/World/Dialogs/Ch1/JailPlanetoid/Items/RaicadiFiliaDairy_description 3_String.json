Kein Adliger, so barmherzig er auch sein mag, würde so etwas je tun, doch dieser Mann ...\nEs hat mit Kleinigkeiten begonnen. Der Direktor ist zum Plaudern vorbeigekommen, wie immer. Nur hat er uns anfangs Fragen gestellt, jetzt aber im Grunde nur noch gepredigt. Wirres Gerede vom Pfad zur Läuterung, vom heiligen Opfer, vom Sehen mit geblendeten Augen ... Ich habe nur zugehört und genickt. Ja, Herr Direktor. Natürlich, Herr Direktor. Er konnte Unsinn reden, so viel er wollte, so lange ich nur weiter die leckeren Mahlzeiten für Optimaten serviert bekommen würde. Ich dachte, alle anderen tun dasselbe, nicken einfach, um dem Direktor zu gefallen.\nIch habe mich geirrt. Bald haben auch die Leute in der Kaserne angefangen, von Läuterung und Blindheit zu faseln. Anscheinend waren wir Optimaten nicht mehr länger nur die Lieblinge des Direktors, wir waren — der Imperator verzeihe mir — 'Propheten', die den Rest dieses jämmerlichen Packs 'retten' sollten. Oder erwecken. Oder ihnen die Augen öffnen. Irgend so ein Unfug.\nEs wurde nun von den Leuten erwartet, dass sie den Optimaten Opfer darbringen. Gestern hat das arme Schwein, das in meinem ersten Jahr hier im Bett unter mir geschlafen hat, sich das eigene verfluchte Ohr abgeschnitten und ist auf Knien zu mir gekrochen gekommen. Er hat mir das Ohr gegeben und mich gebeten, ihn nicht zu verlassen, wenn die Schicksalsstunde schlägt. Was beim Thron soll ich denn bitte mit einem Ohr anfangen? Warum starren mich alle — alle — ständig an?\nDer Direktor hat gesagt, die Zeit sei bald gekommen, das Schicksal habe Großes mit den Optimaten vor.\nIch wollte nachsehen gehen, wie es meinem guten Freund Clensin geht. Er hatte seit drei Monaten kein Wort gesagt, seit ich ihm alle oberen Zähne habe herausreißen lassen. Heute hat er etwas gesagt. Er hat mich direkt angesehen und gesagt: 'Toter Mann.'\nIch habe ihn geschlagen, bis es wehgetan hat. Bis es mir wehgetan hat. Nun sind meine Fäuste und Füße voller blauer Flecken. Die halbe Kaserne stand daneben und hat zugesehen. Und gebetet.\nIch habe Angst ...\""

Ne kadar çatlak olursa olsun hiçbir soylu o tarz bir işe girişmezdi ama o adam...\nBaşta önemsiz şeylerdi. Müdür her zamanki gibi gelip konuşuyordu. Tek farkı, eskiden gelip soru sorarken şimdi çoğunlukla coşkuyla vaaz veriyordu. Arınmaya giden yol, fedakârlığın kutsallığı, kör gözlerle görmekten falan bahsediyordu. Dinleyip kafa salladım geçtim. Evet Müdür Bey, tabii Müdür Bey vesaire. İstediğini saçmalasın, o leziz optimate yemekleri mideme indiği sürece önemli değildi. Diğerlerinin de ihtiyarın huyuna gitmek için benim gibi yaptığını sanıyordum.\nYanılmışım. Vaazlardan sonra kışladakiler de arınma ve körlük zırvalarından bahsetmeye başladı. Dediklerine göre biz optimateler artık sadece müdürün göz bebekleri değil, İmparator affetsin, diğer zavallıları kurtarmak üzere gönderilmiş bir tür 'peygamberdik'. Ya da onları uyandırmak mı, görmelerini sağlamak mı işte her ne haltsa.\nArtık herkesin optimatelere kurban vermesi gerekiyordu. Dün, ilk geldiğimde altımda yatan adı batasıcalardan biri kulağını kesip dizleri üstünde yanıma çöktü. Kulağını bana verip o kader anı geldiğinde onu yüzüstü bırakmamam için yalvardı. Kulakla ne yapacağım ulan ben? Neden herkes ama istisnasız herkes sürekli bana bakıyor?\nMüdür, vaktin yaklaştığını, optimateler için yolun sonunda hakikaten harika şeyler olduğunu söyledi.\nAziz dostum Clensin'in nasıl olduğuna bakmaya gittim. Ben üst dişlerinin hepsini söktürdükten beri üç ay konuşmamıştı. Bugün konuştu. Dosdoğru yüzüme bakıp 'Ölü adam' dedi.\nAcıtana kadar vurmaya devam ettim. Canım acıyana kadar... Elim ve ayaklarım mosmor oldu. Kışladakilerin yarısı öylece durup izledi, bir de dua ettiler.\nKorkuyorum.\""
