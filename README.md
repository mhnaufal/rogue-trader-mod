_⚠️ This code is comes from Warhammer 40.000: Rogue Trader. License is belong to Warhammer 40.000: Rogue Trader. You need to have the game to use this mod_

## NOTES

Each of the party members has at least a couple of blueprints. Let’s look at **Abelard**, for example. His main blueprint file is `Blueprints\Units\Companions\AbelardCompanion\AbelardCompanion.jbp`, and the fix features are inside `Blueprints\Units\Pregens\PartyPregenTests\Abelard\FeatureLists\AbelardFeatureList_1lvl.jbp` (or `AbelardFeatureList_2lvl.jbp`, `AbelardFeatureList_3lvl.jbp`)

When creating your character at the game start, you are given several presets to choose (_Fighter_, _Adept_, etc.). Each preset has its own blueprint too Example 2: Soldier preset blueprints is located at `Blueprints\Backgrounds\CharacterGeneration\StartGame_Pregens\StartGame_Pregen_Soldier.jbp`
